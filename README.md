# closureBOT
A conversational voice chatbot that doesn't suck... too bad.
![house_fire_small](https://github.com/jdx4444/closureBOT/assets/133823909/853e1022-0530-4435-9dca-37b1f9c41654)
This Bot uses elevenlabs for voice sythesis, openai ft gpt3.5, whisper for tts, lanchain for memory and personality prompting, and is capable of providing continous conversation without the user needing to do a single thing other than talk. You can leave it running in the background as you dick around with other things and talk to it as you please.

This is a temporary readme for anyone that might stumble upon this repository before I upload a tutorial on getting the bot to work.

Soon I will have a tutorial on youtube, demonstarting how the bot works.
  - if you plan on trying to make things work yourself, note that the code is meant to use a finetuned gpt3.5 model but can easily be changed to fit a non-finetuned model.

  - the code is 4444 lol

  - sorry for the spaghetti, I'm a hobbiest.

  - I will update the readme so that you don't need to watch the youtube tutorial with proper instructions soon.

  - thanks.
